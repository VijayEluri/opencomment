<p align="center"><b>Open Comment questions</b></p>


<p>
  Open Comment is a formative feedback question type that can be
  embedded within a Moodle quiz. The idea is a fairly simple one:
  questions are put, and an external web service allows customised
  feedback to be generated on each individual attempt.

  The overall concept is 
  related to the Remote Question Protocol, but rather than handling
  any kind of question, Open Comment handles free text questions,
  and uses an XML file to match and provide appropriate feedback.
  This can be implemented by a web service, although it need not
  be.
