How does Socrates argue that courage is not endurance? 

You will find plenty of material relevant to answering this question in Book 2, 
Chapter 8. The question asks you both to explain and to evaluate Laches' 
definition of courage as endurance. You should try to divide your time equally 
between these two tasks. It would be a good idea to focus on those two tasks: 
for example, there is no need to spend time explaining what leads up to the 
argument, or what happens later on in the dialogue.
