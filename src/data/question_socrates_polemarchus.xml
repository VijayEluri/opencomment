Again, this is a different type of question. Here, we are encouraging
precision and phrasing. Only if the key concept has been described, and
using appropriate terms, do we accept. This means we use regular expression
classifiers a lot compared to some other questions. We also need to use
the attempt number; this depends on recent additions to the inteface to
make this testable.
