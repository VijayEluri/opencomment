This is in some ways similar to the previous question, but allows a bit more flexibility by
using the SVM classifier. This is appropriate - the pattern classifier is great when 
expecting relatively precise phrasing: SVM is far more open. 

The target answer is: The conclusion that he reaches is that it is not the nature of 
the just man to harm anyone. Notice that Socrates’ conclusion contradicts Polemarchus’ claim.
